Normality Test

This repository contains code and resources related to finding normality and performing appropriate statistical tests. The goal is to analyze a given dataset and determine if it follows a normal distribution.

Tasks

Data Exploration: Exploration of the dataset and understanding its characteristics. Data visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, or density plots to assess the distribution of the data.

Normality Test

Applied a statistical test to determine if the data follows a normal distribution. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality in the dataset and perform the analysis.

Interpretation

Based on the results of the normality test, with P>0.05, this suggests that the data is normally distributed. If the data is normally distributed, as such we can proceed with parametric statistical tests. Otherwise, if the data is not normally distributed, non-parametric tests or transformations may be necessary.

Appropriate Statistical Test

Based on the nature of your analysis and the objectives of our study, the appropriate statistical test to apply is the paired t-test comparison of means.
